# Evaluating-the-Cost-Effectiveness-of-Sustainable-Practices-in-the-Wedding-Industry

## Project Overview
This project investigates whether wedding vendors that implement sustainable practices offer more cost-effective solutions compared to those that do not. The goal is to understand if choosing environmentally friendly options can also be budget-friendly for consumers.

## Business Question
The primary question this project seeks to answer is: **Are wedding vendors with sustainable practices more cost-effective**? This analysis focuses on the price efficiency of sustainable vendors in comparison to non-sustainable ones.

## Key Terms
  **Sustainable Practices**: In the wedding industry, this refers to vendors using eco-friendly methods such as sourcing local and organic materials, reducing waste, and recycling.
  
  **Cost-Effectiveness**: This refers to achieving the best possible value for money spent, balancing cost with the quality and benefits of the services provided.
    
## Methodology
   **Data Extraction**:
      Using SQL to retrieve relevant data on wedding vendors, focusing on their pricing and sustainability practices.
      
   **Data Analysis**:
      Analyzing the extracted data using Python to create visualizations and derive insights that address the business question.
      
## Insights & Findings
   **Pricing Differences**:
      The analysis showed that non-sustainable wedding vendors tend to be more cost-effective than sustainable ones, offering lower prices with less variability.
      
  **Statistical Evidence**:
      A two-way ANOVA test confirmed significant differences in pricing between sustainable and non-sustainable vendors, with product categories also playing a major role in            cost determination.
      
## Addressing the Business Question
The analysis suggests that while non-sustainable vendors currently offer more cost-effective solutions from a purely financial perspective, the increasing consumer interest in sustainability indicates a shift in market dynamics. Sustainable vendors can potentially succeed by leveraging their unique value propositions and educating consumers on the long-term benefits of sustainability. Thus, the answer to the business question is complex, depending on both price and the evolving consumer values toward sustainability.

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals that while non-sustainable wedding vendors are currently more cost-effective in terms of pricing, the increasing consumer demand for sustainability presents significant opportunities. In regions with a strong focus on sustainability, such as the San Francisco Bay Area, sustainable vendors may find a competitive edge by refining their pricing strategies and enhancing consumer awareness. Educating consumers on the long-term environmental and social benefits of sustainable practices could shift market dynamics, making sustainability not just an ethical choice but also a financially viable one. Continued research and strategic efforts will be essential for sustainable vendors to bridge the cost gap and capitalize on evolving consumer values.
